# EMU Z-Plane Filter Enhancement

## Problem/Goal
Transform the current basic cascaded lowpass filter implementation into an authentic EMU-style Z-plane morphing filter with musical character, stability guards, and professional polish. The filter currently sounds like a "generic digital EQ" instead of the legendary EMU Z-plane morphing filters.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Parameter smoothing eliminates zippering (20-30ms ramps)
- [x] T1/T2 tables drive authentic morphing behavior (not just freq/Q)
- [x] Proper biquad coefficient calculation with bilinear transform
- [x] Per-stage saturation adds musical harmonics (not harsh distortion)
- [x] Intensity macro provides single "wow factor" control
- [x] Auto-makeup gain maintains consistent loudness during sweeps (±6dB)
- [x] DC blocker prevents low-frequency buildup
- [x] Pink noise sweep reveals moving resonances (not static EQ)
- [x] CPU usage increase < 5%
- [x] Passes pluginval validation strictness 10

## Context Files
- fieldEngine/Source/Core/DSPEngine.h:205-300  # ZPlaneFilter implementation
- fieldEngine/Source/Core/ZPlaneTables_T1.h    # Authentic EMU frequency tables
- fieldEngine/Source/Core/ZPlaneTables_T2.h    # Authentic EMU Q tables
- fieldEngine/juce/PluginProcessor.cpp         # APVTS parameter setup
- fieldEngine/juce/PluginEditor.cpp            # UI controls

## User Notes
Key improvements needed:
1. True pole/zero domain morphing (currently just freq/Q mapping)
2. Parameter smoothing to prevent zipper noise
3. EMU-style saturation and character
4. Musical controls (intensity macro, auto-makeup)
5. Professional stability and polish

The existing T1/T2 tables are reverse-engineered from real EMU hardware (Audity 2000, Orbit, etc.) and should be leveraged for authentic sound.

### Discovered During Implementation
[Date: 2025-09-17 / GUI Crash Investigation]

During GUI implementation and FL Studio compatibility testing, we discovered critical namespace conflicts and repository organization issues that weren't documented in the original context. This wasn't documented because the project had undergone multiple UI refactoring attempts leading to scattered components.

**GUI Crash Root Cause:**
The plugin crashed in FL Studio and pluginval testing due to `fe_ui::BankRegistry bankRegistry` being constructed as a direct member variable in PluginEditor.h. This component, along with `fe_ui::FESecretEngineViz` and related UI widgets, had namespace conflicts with scattered implementations between `fieldEngine/ui/` and `fe_ui_disabled/` directories.

**Repository Structure Problems:**
The codebase organization revealed significant technical debt with UI components scattered across:
- `fieldEngine/ui/` - Active UI implementation files
- `fe_ui_disabled/` - Conflicting library causing namespace issues
- Include path confusion causing build system conflicts

**FL Studio Compatibility Discovery:**
FL Studio requires more careful GUI initialization than standalone testing reveals. The timer callback accessing disabled components caused secondary crashes, requiring complete UI component disabling for basic plugin functionality.

**Minimal UI Solution:**
Future implementations need to account for scattered UI architecture and use minimal UI approach for initial DAW compatibility, then gradually re-enable components after namespace cleanup.

#### Updated Technical Details
- GUI crash pattern: Direct construction of fe_ui components causes segfaults
- Build system requirement: Global CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD enforcement needed for C++20
- DAW compatibility: pluginval Editor tests catch issues that basic builds miss
- Repository cleanup needed: UI namespace consolidation required for full GUI features

### 2025-09-17 - Session 8: Audity 2000 Bank Integration Complete
