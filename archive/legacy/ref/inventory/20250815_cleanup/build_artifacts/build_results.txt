================================
Date: 2025-08-11
Build Type: Release (Optimized)
JUCE Version: 7.0.12

Build Status:
- VST3 Plugin: SUCCESS
- Standalone: SUCCESS
- Unit Tests: FAILED (missing juce_dsp module - not critical)

Build Locations:
- VST3: build\SpectralCanvas_artefacts\Release\VST3\SpectralCanvas Pro.vst3
- Standalone: build\SpectralCanvas_artefacts\Release\Standalone\SpectralCanvas Pro.exe

Optimization Flags Applied:
- /O2 (Optimize for speed)
- /GL (Whole program optimization)
- /LTCG (Link-time code generation)
- /OPT:REF (Remove unreferenced code)
- /OPT:ICF (Identical COMDAT folding)
- Debug symbols stripped

Pluginval Test Results (Strictness Level 4):
- Plugin scan: PASS
- Open plugin (cold): PASS
- Open plugin (warm): PASS
- Plugin info: PASS
- Plugin programs: PASS
- Editor: PASS
- Open editor whilst processing: FAIL (segfault - known issue from previous session)

Note: The "Open editor whilst processing" failure is the race condition issue 
that was being investigated earlier. The plugin builds successfully with 
optimizations but the RT-safety issue persists.
