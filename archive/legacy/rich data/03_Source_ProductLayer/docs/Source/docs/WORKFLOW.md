# ARTEFACT — Personal Development Workflow

## Weekly Time Budget
| Slot | Time | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Code Block A | Mon 19:30-21:30 | Work on one roadmap task |
| Music Jam | Tue 20:00-22:00 | Pure creativity |
| Partner / Social | Wed evening | Zero screens |
| Code Block B | Thu 19:30-21:30 | Second task |
| Weekly Review | Sun 20:00-20:30 | Update ROADMAP + pick next tasks |
| Overflow (opt) | Sat morning | Bug-fix / refactor / extra music |

## “Pencils Down” Rule  
When a block ends, stop, commit (`// TODO` if broken), update ROADMAP, close IDE.

## AI-Assisted Learning Loop  
1 Direct → 2 Receive → 3 Interrogate → 4 Integrate → 5 Verify.

## Living Roadmap Policy  
ROADMAP.md is authoritative — update every session, paste into every AI chat, copy “Current Task” to your whiteboard.
