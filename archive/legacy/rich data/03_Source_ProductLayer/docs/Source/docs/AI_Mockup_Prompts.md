## Implementation Strategy

1. **Generate Base Mockups** using Recraft V3 for vector compatibility
2. **Refine with Midjourney** for artistic vintage aesthetics  
3. **Detail Enhancement** with Stable Diffusion for specific elements
4. **Upscale Results** using AI upscaling tools
5. **Extract Design Elements** for JUCE implementation
6. **Create Style Guide** from best results

## Usage Instructions

1. Use these prompts in Recraft V3 for vector mockups
2. Export SVG elements for direct use in development
3. Iterate prompts based on results
4. Maintain consistency across all interface sections
5. Focus on functional professional design over flashy aesthetics
