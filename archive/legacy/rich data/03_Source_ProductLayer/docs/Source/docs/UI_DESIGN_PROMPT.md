# SoundCanvas Beatmaker UI - Image Generation Prompt

## Master Prompt for UI Mockup

Create a digital interface design for a music production plugin called "SoundCanvas Beatmaker". The design should be **dated but functional**, inspired by early 2000s software like FL Studio, Reason, and hardware drum machines.

### Overall Layout Specifications:
- **Window size**: 1000px wide x 700px tall
- **Color scheme**: Dark theme with orange accents
- **Background**: Dark gray (#2a2a2a)
- **Typography**: Monospace font (Courier New style)
- **Grid lines**: Subtle gray (#444444)
- **Active elements**: Bright orange (#ff6b35)
- **Playhead**: Bright green (#00ff41)

### Top Section (50px height):
**Transport Bar** with these elements from left to right:
- Play button (triangle), Stop button (square), Record button (circle)
- BPM display showing "140" in a digital LCD style
- Pattern name field showing "Untitled_01"
- Undo button (curved arrow icon)

### Main Section Layout:

**Left Panel (200px width) - Sound Browser:**
- Header: "SOUNDS" in bold monospace text
- Category tabs: "DRUMS | BASS | KEYS | FX"
- File list showing:
  - "808_Kick_01.wav"
  - "Snare_Tight.wav" 
  - "HiHat_Closed.wav"
  - "HiHat_Open.wav"
  - "Clap_Vintage.wav"
- Small waveform previews next to each sound name

**Center Panel (600px width) - Beat Sequencer Grid:**
- **8 horizontal rows** labeled on left:
  - "KICK"
  - "SNARE" 
  - "CL HAT"
  - "OP HAT"
  - "CRASH"
  - "BASS"
  - "LEAD"
  - "FX"

- **16 vertical columns** (steps) with numbers 1-4 repeating (representing bars)
- Grid cells are square boxes
- Some cells filled with orange (#ff6b35) to show active beats
- Typical drum pattern visible:
  - Kick on steps 1, 5, 9, 13
  - Snare on steps 5, 13
  - Closed hats on steps 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16
- Bright green vertical line at step 7 (playhead position)

**Right Panel (200px width) - Track Controls:**
- 8 channel strips, each containing:
  - Track name at top
  - Volume slider (vertical)
  - Pan knob (rotary)
  - Mute button (M)
  - Solo button (S)
  - Sound selection dropdown

### Bottom Section (150px height):
**Selected Sample Controls** showing:
- Large waveform display
- Pitch slider (-12 to +12)
- Speed slider (0.5x to 2.0x)
- Filter knob (Low Pass)
- Volume slider
- "ASSIGN TO TRACK" button

### Visual Style Details:
- **Flat design**: No gradients, shadows, or 3D effects
- **Sharp corners**: All rectangles and buttons have 90-degree corners
- **High contrast**: White text on dark backgrounds
- **LCD-style numbers**: Digital clock font for BPM and step numbers
- **Grid pattern**: Visible grid lines throughout the sequencer
- **Retro color accents**: Orange highlights, green playhead
- **Minimalist icons**: Simple geometric shapes for transport controls

### Additional UI Elements:
- Small CPU usage meter in top-right corner
- "Pattern: 1/4" indicator showing current pattern
- Time signature display "4/4"
- Subtle scan lines effect across the entire interface (very faint)

The overall aesthetic should feel like software from 2003-2007: functional, grid-based, slightly chunky, but clean and purposeful. Think Fruity Loops 4, early Ableton Live, or Reason 3.0 interface design language.
